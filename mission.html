	<strong>My mission with Cabrales Critique is 
	to help others build a strong foundation in the elements of English writing, 
	allowing an individual the knowledge and confidence to achieve a college-level writing skill
	set. 
	I plan to achieve my mission by strongly emphasizing paragraph and sentence structures with the use of outlining that is easy to learn while providing support and examples if necessary. 
	So, please join me and let us both achieve success and growth in our education. </strong><br>
	</br><strong>If a student needs quality, fast peer-reviewed papers, 
	then my mission, as well, is to provide excellent editing for individuals 
	in need of constructive criticism.
