	<p>My name is Alexander Cabrales and I'm twenty-six years old. I was born in Hayward, CA and raised in Fremont, CA. Growing up I’ve always had strong comprehension skills and I read well; however, my writing was atrocious looking back at it now. All throughout my early education I neglected to address the problems in my writing—fragments, wordy sentences, and awful structure. My writing was a mess. It wasn’t until I entered college did I realize that I needed to fix my writing problems. So, after dropping my first college English class, I decided I needed to change my writing habits. So, I used the extra time to work hard on structure and grammar rules for the next semester. The next semester I did everything I could to become a better writer and succeed. Thankfully through hard work and determination I aced my English class and soon began to realize that I had the ability and resources to achieve a college writing level. I began to approach all my English classes with the same philosophy that I could succeed as long as I was open-minded, hard-working, and willing to change for the better. With this philosophy I was able to conquer the University standards in achieving a Clear Competence in writing and acquired my ultimate education goal of a Bachelor’s degree. 
Yet, when I think back to my experiences in school, I begin to realize that I wish that I had paid for a tutor in the beginning of my college education. Although most colleges offer tutor services for free, a majority of students, including myself, worked a lot and didn’t have time to go see the school tutors, but I wish I had the time. I wish, like a lot of students, that I had a tutor that understood the struggle that I was going through and knew a good course of action to take to achieve success without being to demeaning about it. But, sadly, at the time, most tutors offering services around the area were charging too much money (in my opinion) for quality criticism. So, I did what any broke college student would do: I ignored sleep and worked ten times harder to succeed in writing. 
And, it wasn’t until I acquired this job at Ohlone as a tutor did I realize that a lot of people, like myself, are dealing with this struggle of trying to get better at writing while trying to maintain a work schedule. 
And after a couple classmates in my Trigonometry class began to ask for help in their writing I soon saw the potential of English editing as a business, and how this business could help people grow. So I’ve started Cabrales Critique to help students in need of help without breaking their bank and schedule.</p>
